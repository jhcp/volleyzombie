### Volley Zombie

This is a game where you play volleyball while killing some zombies, skeletons, 
and other monsters. It was created within a week as an entry to
 [The Liberation Pixel Cup](http://lpc.opengameart.org/) contest.

You play as Thomas, whom went off from work to wind down in the beach and got
invited to a strange volleyball game...
You control Thomas as he moves around the level, jumping to serve the ball and
shooting a little something just to send away the monsters that keep appearing
in his field. I don't know what he shoots, but whatever it is, it is quite
effective, as no monster ever came back after being shot...


	CONTROLS:

	W - move up
	S - move down
	A - move left
	D - move right
	SPACE or SHIFT - jump

	Arrow keys - shoot

	P - Pause
	F11 - toggle fullscreen (most browsers)

### Running the game

This game was built with pure HTML, Javascript and CSS, thus no compilation,
installation or build is required. All you have to do in order to play
it is to open index.html in a web browser.

As it uses HTML5 features, it is recommended that you use an up-to-date
browser. It was successfully tested on Opera and Google Chrome.

If you wish to change its source code, the file zombieVolley.js is a good
starting point. The code uses the [Crafty framework](http://craftyjs.com ) v0.4.9

In order to use a newer version of Crafty you may need to change its target FPS to 40 in its source file.

Before deployment, it is adviseable (though not required) to combine
and minify the Javascript files
